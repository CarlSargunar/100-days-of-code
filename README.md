# 100-days-of-code

# Idea/Why
Inspired by [@Migaroez](https://github.com/Migaroez/) I'm doing a 100 days of code to build a ToDo App in various languages so I don't get stuck in a purely back end development role.

# Scope
## General
The program will be split up into a mix of back end, web and platform based - split into 
 - Presentation, 
 - Communication
 - Logic
 - Storage
 - Testing

All Communication layers (API) should in essence serve the same output so all detached Presentation layers can process them.
Where possible, each layer should be loosly coupled so they can be reused.

### Features
- Add/Remove Todo items
- Mark/Unmark Todo items
- Add/remove/edit notes on todo item (shows how to handle data dependecy and component usage)

### Out of scope
- Authentication/authorization (user and aplication wide)

# Tech stacks
### Presentation
Where possible it should be componentized
List of presentation technologies
- [ ] Console 
- [ ] Mvc/html/css 
- [ ] Vue2/bootstrap 
- [ ] Vue3/bootstrap

- [ ] WPF 
- [ ] MAUI (With new MVVM framework)
- [ ] Winforms
- [ ] Js/html/css
- [ ] React
- [ ] React Native
- [ ] AngularJs

- [ ] Native Android

### Communcation
- [ ] C# MVC 
- [ ] C# REST Api
- [ ] Nodejs Api
- [ ] Go Api
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] C++ (Native Android)

### Logic
Will be linked to the communcation layer but plans are to use these languages
- [ ] C# (.Net 5)
- [ ] Nodejs
- [ ] Go
- [ ] C++
- [ ] PHP

### Storage
This wil be a mix between plain integrations and using ORMs and not all will be done in every language
- [ ] MSSQL 
- [ ] MYSQL 
- [ ] PostgreSQL
- [ ] NPOCO/PETAPOCO 
- [ ] Entityframework
- [ ] LocalStorage
- [ ] MongoDb
- [ ] Redis
- [ ] CosmosDB
- [ ] File
- [ ] Umbraco

### Testing
Testing the UI, the back end or any service code
